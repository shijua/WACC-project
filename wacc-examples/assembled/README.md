# Assembly Files

This folder stores all assembled `.wacc` files that have successfully passed the compiler.

The file names & relative paths should be identical to their original names and paths in the respective `/valid` folder,
expect that they are now ending in `.s` format.

For example, `valid/advanced/binarySortTree.wacc` should now be stored at `assembled/advanced/binarySortTree.s`.
